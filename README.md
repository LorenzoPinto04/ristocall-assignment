# ASSIGNMENT

## Hey there, if you are reading this means you applied for our dev position in RC. Nice to have you here. 
## Due to the number of applications we decided to set up a small assignment to validate your knowledge. 


# TASK 1:

1 - Create a Flask App and display in an html template 20 users cards as in the file mockups/iphone-x-xs-11-pro-1.html (using dummy data from backend)

2 - Implement the scrolling to display up to 500 users 

3 - Find the most efficient and fast way to display the results without compromising with speed and usability. Ideally we want to prevent to load the whole cards





## Once done share the link of the new repo with the result with lorenzo.pinto@ristocall.com
